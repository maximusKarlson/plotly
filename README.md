# Plotly, Dash and Ploty-Express

This repository contains descriptions on *how to use plotly* for data visualization properly.  
`Plotly` introduced **plotly-express** for exactly this use-case. 

>Plotly Express is a new high-level Python visualization library: itâ€™s a wrapper for Plotly.py that exposes a simple syntax for complex charts. Inspired by Seaborn and ggplot2, it was specifically designed to have a terse, consistent and easy-to-learn API: with just a single import, you can make richly interactive plots in just a single function call, including faceting, maps, animations, and trendlines. It comes with on-board datasets, color scales and themes, and just like Plotly.py, Plotly Express is totally free: with its permissive open-source MIT license, you can use it however you like (yes, even in commercial products!). Best of all, Plotly Express is fully compatible with the rest of Plotly ecosystem: use it in your Dash apps, export your figures to almost any file format using Orca, or edit them in a GUI with the JupyterLab Chart Editor!

It is comaparble to `seaborn` but obviously adds the beloved *interactive* javascript parts.
Very powerful tool - check it out.

Besides the Plotly / Plotly-Express part this repository also contains an example for how powerful plotly is when it comes to dashboards.

>Dash is a user interface library for creating analytical web applications. Those who use Python for data analysis, data exploration, visualization, modelling, instrument control, and reporting will find immediate use for Dash.

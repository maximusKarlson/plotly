# Plotly and Ploty-Express

This repository contains descriptions on *how to use plotly" for data visualization properly.  
`Plotly` introduced **plotly-express** for exactly this use-case. 

It is comaparble to `seaborn` but obviously adds the *interactive* parts to it.

Very powerful tool - check it out.
